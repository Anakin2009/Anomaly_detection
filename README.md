# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository is dedicated to detecting credit card fraud using the European Card Data (ECD) dataset. The primary goal is to identify fraudulent transactions to prevent customers from being charged for items they did not purchase.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains anonymized credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. It consists of 284,807 transactions, out of which 492 are labeled as frauds. Due to the highly unbalanced nature of the dataset, the positive class (frauds) account for only 0.172% of all transactions.
The dataset is available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.
